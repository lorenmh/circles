# Circles w/ Drag and Drop
Input a number at the top to specify the number of circles you would like
created.

That number of circles will be assigned a random position. The color of the
circle is based on the x/y coordinate of the circle.

At the bottom right is the x/y coords of the mouse.

## Notes:
Resizing won't work / will probably break things. Moving the mouse off of the
screen while dragging probably will break things.

The algorithm I used to place the circles might seem a bit odd; I did it this
way for fun, if performance were a concern then it shouldn't be done this way.

The drag-and-drop is pretty rudimentary.

The error message is basically unstyled.

Pretty bare-bones!
